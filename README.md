# Web Components - Parent Child Communication Example

This repo shows an example of parent child communication of single nested components with Web Components.

Feel free to customize the repo according to your wishes.

The repo includes

- a simple counter that can be incremented over several components and
- a text that can be shown and hidden (toggled) in the different components.

The CSS was mainly implemented with Bootstrap 5 and should not play a special role in this repo (e.g. not responsive).
